      "Choice": [ "Toughness", "Agility", "Willpower" ],
      "Description": "You hail from an agri world, a planet dedicated to the sole purpose of producing food to satiate the teeming masses of the Imperium. Few industrialised planets have the resources to maintain their populace and require the output of Agri Worlds to fulfil their duty to the Emperor. Vast swaths of land are dedicated to the production of the most valuable crops or livestock, and millions of litres of potable water are extracted daily. A heavy tithe is expected of every Agri World. Some meet these onerous requirements by means of technological wonders, their secrets long forgotten, though most rely on the backbreaking toil of their inhabitants. As an Agri Worlder, your early life was likely dedicated to preparation for some form of farming. Most agri worlders are physically strong, tough workers used to unrelenting toil. Others are dextrous, dedicated to delicate if monotonous tasks, while others still have minds for the detailed organisation required to optimise a planet of production and are sought out by the Administratum.",

      "Choice": [ "BallisticsSkill", "Perception", "Fellowship" ],
      "Description": "You hail from a hive world, a planet dominated by one or more titanic vertical cities known as ‘hives’. A hive is essentially hundreds of cities stacked one on top of the other, with the population of a single hive city often in the billions. No two hives are identical, but most are sealed environments where everything from the air citizens breathe, to their very bodies, are perpetually recycled — ‘hivers’ rarely leave the level they are born on, let alone the hive city itself. These massive populations are set to work in vast manufactora to fulfil the insatiable industrial labour needs of the Imperium. Life is strictly stratified, with the highborn living in the upper reaches with access to air and sunlight, and the middle levels devoted to perpetual toil. Those that will not accept a life of endless labour sink into the lawless bowels of the lower hive, where criminals and cults hold sway, and only the strong endure.",

      "Description": "You hail from a forge world, a planet controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus, dedicated to the production of technology, the acquisition of knowledge, and worship of the Machine God. Forge worlds produce and maintain the advanced machinery of the Imperium, supplying it to other worlds on the basis of ancient treaties or recent pacts, in exchange for raw materials and the acknowledgement of their primacy in technological and scientific matters. The surfaces of most forge worlds are covered with manufactorums, tech-shrines, auto-foundries, macro-generatorums, data temples, and so on. These often extend deep into the planet, any ecosystem long ago purged by unrestrained industry, and as a result, most unaugmented Humans cannot survive on their surfaces. Most people that come from a forge world are members of the Cult Mechanicus and are familiar with advanced technology.",

      "Description": "You were born in the void; either aboard an Imperial spacefaring vessel, such as a colossal warp-capable voidship traversing the stars, or one of the many system-bound vessels that never leave the system they were constructed in, or even one of the countless stations around the sector. Voidships are commonly miles long, marvels of misunderstood technology, and function as makeshift cities during voyages that might take anywhere from days to decades. Void stations are even larger, ancient mechanical worldlets floating in a vacuum. Societies in these gargantuan artificial cities are influenced by their purpose, often defensive, and the history of the vessel itself. Entire cultures can form aboard a ship, spread throughout hundreds of its decks, and die out before any of its denizens ever set foot on a single world. Your life may have differed dramatically from that of someone born planetside, having dealt with problems such as zero-gravity, the vacuum of the void, and the nightmares of the warp.",

      "Description": "You hail from a feral world, a planet with little to no technological development. Societies on feral worlds are often small, and may rely on hunting and gathering to survive. Though Adeptus Ministorum preachers ensure most at least know of the Emperor, life on feral worlds is far removed from the Imperial norm. Inhabitants battle against the elements, and deadly fauna may be common, resulting in a hardy and resourceful populace. Some question why the wider Imperium does not develop feral worlds to a more ‘civilised’ state that could result in greater Tithes. One answer is that they consistently produce remarkably strong willed and capable warriors — many Astra Militarum regiments draw from such worlds, as do a number of Space Marine Chapters. Another answer is simple mismanagement, or a sheer lack of the resources, time, and available personnel to do so while in a state of endless war.",

      "Description": "Wherever you were born, you don’t remember it. You are Progena, an orphan whose parents died in service to the Imperium. You were brought to a Schola Progenium, one of many orphanages run by the Ecclesiarchy on various worlds of the Imperium, all designed to create the ideal servants of the God-Emperor of Mankind. Your memories of life before the schola were wiped from your consciousness, leaving you a blank slate, clay to be moulded into an uncompromising leader, a dauntless warrior, a zealous preacher — whatever the Imperium needed most. Your early years were an unyieldingly severe regime of religious indoctrination, physical conditioning, and exacting education. You emerged from the schola a disciplined exemplar of the Imperial Creed, ready to excel in His name.",

Shrine worlds are often crowded by cathedrums and temples merging into one another, fortified basilica towering miles high, and colossal shrines to the God-Emperor and a myriad of Imperial Saints. A shrine world is typically assigned its holy status due to a specific event believed to have occurred there, such as the birth or demise of a saint, a turning point in a crusade or War of Faith, or an alleged miracle. The Ecclesiarchy govern the shrine worlds of the Imperium, imposing the most rigid strictures of the Imperial Creed. As such, their denizens are often deeply devout, as well as experienced in dealing with diverse folk making holy pilgrimages to their home.",

      "Description": "You hail from a feudal world, a place where technology has regressed to pre-industrial levels. Some worlds have fallen into this state via isolation, as invasion, warp storms, or even a clerical error by the Adeptus Administratum saw the world cut off from the wider Imperium for centuries or more. Here, all records of the Imperium may have passed into myth, and the Adeptus Ministorum often visits such worlds to ensure their faith in the Emperor has endured. Some worlds are deliberately kept in a state of technological regression by a ruling class who hoard what machinery exists to quell any challenge to their authority. Others are kept this way out of a belief that such conditions give rise to great warriors. Indeed, the tithe of most feudal worlds is paid in soldiers for the Astra Militarum, as they rarely have much else to offer.",
